# Spring MVC Template for Salesforce

This is a template for a Spring MVC web application to work with data from Salesforce.
The sample code is a dynamic CRUD application that allows users to create, read, edit, and delete any Salesforce object.
It is backed by the [Rich SObjects](https://github.com/ryanbrainard/richsobjects) library for interactions with Salesforce.

## Getting Started

This template is designed to be [cloned with the AgI service](https://agi.herokuapp.com/clone?template=template-sfdc-java-springmvc&callbackUrl=/_auth),
which will automatically create your own app based on this template in your [Heroku](http://heroku.com) account.
It will also assist you with setting up remote access configuration to connect to the Salesforce API.
After cloning and configuration are complete, you will be provided with instructions to make local changes and deploy to Heroku.
